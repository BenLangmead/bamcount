# bamcount

BigWig and BAM related utilities.

## Build dependencies

conda install -c conda-forge seqan-library
```

## Compiling

SeqAn uses C++14.

## Subcommands

### `bamcount nonref`

Outputs information about non-reference-matching portions of reads.
Output is comma separated with 4 fields:

| Pos   |                                            Descrtiption |
|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Reference record ID                                     |
| 2     | POS field (1-based offset of leftmost aligned ref base) |
| 3     | Operation label (see table below)                       |
| 4     | Extra info (see table below)                            |


These could be of a few types, summarized in this table.  All of
these are available when the `MD:Z` extra flag is present.  If not
present, only the ones with "Yes" in the "No `MD:Z`" column are
reported.

| Label | Type       |          Extra info  | No `MD:Z`  |
|-------|------------|----------------------|------------|
| `X`   | Mismatch   |            Read base |         No |
| `D`   | Deletion   |      # deleted bases |        Yes |
| `I`   | Insertion  |  Inserted read bases |        Yes |
| `S`   | Soft clip  |   Soft ckipped bases |        Yes |
| `H`   | Hard clip  |            (nothing) |        Yes |
| `P`   | Padding    |            (nothing) |        Yes |

See the usage message for options, which can selectively disable some
of the outputs listed above.  E.g. the soft-clipping outputs can be
very large, so they're not printed unless `--include-softclip` is
specified.

### `bamcount bigwig`

Convert to bigWig (not implemented).

Maybe if this were implemented, we should instead have it be enabled
with an option so that we can write both the `nonref` output and the
bigWig in the same pass.
